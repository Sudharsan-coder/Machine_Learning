Logistic regression is a popular statistical technique used for analyzing the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is used to model the probability of a binary outcome.

Suppose we have a dataset with two independent variables X1 and X2 and one binary dependent variable Y, which takes values 0 or 1. The goal of logistic regression is to predict the probability of Y=1 given the values of X1 and X2.

The logistic regression model can be written as:

p(Y=1|X1,X2) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))

where z is a linear combination of the independent variables and the coefficients:

z = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2

The coefficients β0, β1, and β2 are estimated from the data using a maximum likelihood estimation method. The logistic regression model assumes that the log odds of the probability of Y=1 is a linear function of the independent variables, i.e.,

log(odds(Y=1)) = log(p(Y=1)/(1-p(Y=1))) = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2

The odds of Y=1 is defined as the ratio of the probability of Y=1 to the probability of Y=0, i.e.,

odds(Y=1) = p(Y=1)/(1-p(Y=1))

The log odds can take any value between negative infinity and positive infinity, whereas the odds can take any positive value. The sigmoid function is used to map the log odds to a probability between 0 and 1:

p(Y=1|X1,X2) = 1 / (1 + exp(-log(odds(Y=1))))

= 1 / (1 + exp(-(β0 + β1X1 + β2X2)))

The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve and is defined as:

sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))

where z is any real number. The sigmoid function maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

In logistic regression, the sigmoid function is used to transform the linear combination of the independent variables and the coefficients into a probability of the dependent variable taking the value 1. If the probability is greater than 0.5, the predicted class is 1, otherwise it is 0.

To summarize, logistic regression is a statistical technique for modeling the probability of a binary outcome using one or more independent variables. The logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, is used to map the linear combination of the independent variables and the coefficients to a probability between 0 and 1. The coefficients are estimated from the data using a maximum likelihood estimation method.
