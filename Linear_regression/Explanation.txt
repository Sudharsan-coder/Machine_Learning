Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a
dependent variable and one or more independent variables.It is used to predict the value of
the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

In a linear regression model, the dependent variable is typically represented by y and the 
independent variables are represented by x1, x2, etc. The relationship between y and the x variables 
is represented by a linear equation of the form y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn,
where b0, b1, b2, etc. are the coefficients that determine the slope and intercept of the regression line.

To fit a linear regression model, we use a set of data points consisting of the x and y variables.
The goal is to find the coefficients b0, b1, b2, etc. that best fit the data and minimize the prediction error. 
This is typically done using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent.

Linear regression is a widely used method for predicting continuous variables and is particularly useful
when the relationship between the dependent and independent variablesis approximately linear. 
However, it is important to note that it may not always be appropriate to use linear regression, 
especially if the relationship between the variables is more complex.
